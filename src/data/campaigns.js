    Caption: `On the one hand where winter is welcomed by the privileged wealthy people with colorful pashminas and festive moods 
      forbye, it brings a lot of suffering to the impoverished of our country. Quite sadly, many of the poor can't afford to buy 
      warm clothes for winter. In this scenario, children tend to suffer the most. Keeping them in mind, Sahyog took the initiative 
      to put a smile on their face. A campaign was run at Karanjora Village of Bankura on 15th December, where Members of Sahyog 
      donated new winter clothes and any amount of money they could generously give for this noble cause, thereby adding some 
      positivity to arguably the 'Worst Year Ever?'`,
