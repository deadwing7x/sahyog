    Testimonial: `"Be the change that you want to see in this world”. ― a saying by Gandhi inspired me. I, along with the 
      group of confidants, started the organization 'SAHYOG'. We founded this NGO because we wanted to give an opportunity to 
      help the underprivileged societies, children, people. I have always held the belief that through innovation and grassroots 
      efforts our young people can transform this country. I'm happy to say, we have been blessed with a dedicated team, due to 
      which our expectations have surpassed. Sahyog is on a mission. A mission that will bring on a change for the betterment.`,

    Testimonial: `Happiness comes from sharing. We all have a lifetime of opportunities to do something for the society, however, 
      there are people who urgently need help right now. As you read this, there are children across India who need urgent access 
      to food, shelter, education, and care. You can give as much or as little as you want, but each small effort can bring in a 
      smile to a person, which is priceless. Sahyog may not be able to bring about a humungous change, but we can certainly bring 
      in a hope for a few.`

      that one should do something for the underpriviledged children of the society. Seeing the poverty and living conditions of underpriviledged 
      children. Through Sahyog I would like to work for their betterment of life !!!`,

    Position: "Advisory Committee",
    Testimonial: `At sahyog, we believe that every child is entitled to education, learning. Something that is being overlooked, 
      especially when it comes to the underprivileged children. We strongly believe that change starts with a few individuals 
      taking a stand and that is what we do. We begin as individuals trying to bring about a difference and in turn develop, 
      motivate and encourage these children who can then become the actual changemakers.`,

      (something I really enjoy personally). It has also increased my ability to adapt to different cultural demands and behavioural 
      expectations and my ability to handle sensitive situations. Other than that, Sahyog has broadened my perspective and changed 
      the way I pursue my objectives and make decisions. To sum it up, it has had a positive impact on my life.`,
